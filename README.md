Render Blender Cycles animations using ALL of your rendering devices!

This script dispatches individual frames to the selected rendering devices and displays the progress in a neat way. 
This approach allows blender to use multiple graphics APIs and the CPU to render a single animation. 

This script is brand new and not in a completed state. It is not user friendly at all so be prepared to get your hands dirty and dig into the code. Youâ€™ll definitely need to modify a few variables to get it running on your machine. 

Only tested on Linux
